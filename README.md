# 👋 Hi, I’m Elvin  

⚙️ Platform Engineer | ☁️ Cloud Automation | 🤖 AI/MLOps | 📈 Applied AI in Trading & Investing  

I build and automate **cloud platforms** using tools like Terraform, Kubernetes, and CI/CD to make systems reliable, scalable, and secure.  

Now I’m expanding into **AI and machine learning**, combining that foundation with my passion for **trading and investing**. My focus is on creating:  
- **Day trading automation** → systems that can take trades or signal when to act.  
- **Investment AI** → models that surface the best opportunities to grow wealth.  

My goal is to bridge **traditional cloud engineering** with **applied AI for finance**, building platforms that don’t just run reliably but also **make smarter decisions**.
